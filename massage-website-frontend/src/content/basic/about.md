## During the Massage

During your massage, we want to make sure you are as comfortable as possible, 
so make sure to point out to your masseuse any sensitive areas on your body. 
Before your massage, your masseuse will ask you how much pressure you would like applied during your massage session, 
you can choose from "Hard", "Medium", or "Light". If they are applying too much pressure, 
don't be afraid to stop them in the middle of your massage and ask them to adjust the amount of pressure to fit your specific needs. 

## Hot Stone Massage (Geothermal Therapy)

Hot stone massages, also known as geothermal therapy, is a type of massage that focuses on the application of stones to
the body. The stones are heated up before the massage and then placed onto your body to help relieve tension and repair damaged tissue. 
There are many benefits to a hot stone massage, which includes muscle pain relief, reduced stress/anxiety levels, greater joint
flexibility, and even improved sleep quality. Hot stone massages usually run at temperatures in between 130 - 140 degrees Fahrenheit, 
but if the temperature becomes too uncomfortable, a lowered temperature may be used upon request. 

Before a hot stone massage, it is well advised for you to first consult your doctor in case of any conditions you may have so that you know 
this massage can be safely performed on your body. If you have any damaged, bruised skin, scrapes, cuts, burns of any degree, you must tell your masseuse 
beforehand so that they'll avoid placing the stones over certain areas of your body. If you are sick with a cold, flu, or fever, you must wait until after
you have recovered before undergoing a hot stone massage.
